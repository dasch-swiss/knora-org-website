title: Release 1.4.0
date: 2018-04-30

---
#### Required changes to existing data:
Every ontology must now have the property `knora-base:attachedToProject`, which points to the IRI of the project that is responsible for the ontology. This must be added to each project-specific ontology in existing repositories. All built-in ontologies have been updated to have this property, and must, therefore, be reloaded into existing repositories.
The property `knora-base:projectOntology` has been removed, and must be removed from project definitions in existing repositories.

Every project now needs to have the property `knora-base:projectShortcode` set.

<!--
#### New features:
- Added OpenAPI / Swagger API documentation route
- The Knora API server now checks the validity of ontologies on startup.
- The property `knora-base:projectShortcode` is now a required property (was optional).

#### Bugfixes:

- API v1 extended search was not properly handling multiple conditions
on list values
- Fix image orientation in SALSAH 1
